    "## Commenting Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are created in Python using the pound sign (`#`) and should be **brief statements no longer than a few sentences**.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "def hello_world():\n",
    "  # A simple comment preceding a simple print statement\n",
    "  print(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [PEP 8](http://pep8.org/#maximum-line-length), comments should have a **maximum length of 72** characters. This is true even if your project changes the max line length to be greater than the recommended 80 characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "def hello_long_world():\n",
    "    # A very long statement that just goes on and on and on and on and\n",
    "    # never ends until after it's reached the 80 char limit\n",
    "    print(\"Hellooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo World\")\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of Commenting Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Planning and reviewing**\n",
    "  When developing new portion of code, first use comments as a way of planning or outlineing that section of code. **Remember to remove these comments once the actual coding has been implemented and reviewed/tested**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ~~~python\n",
    "  def new_function():\n",
    "    # Step 1\n",
    "    # Step 2\n",
    "    # Step 3\n",
    "    \n",
    "  ~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code description** \n",
    "  Explain the intent of specific sections of code\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithmic description**\n",
    "  When algorithms are used, especially complicated ones, it can be useful to explain how the algorithm works or how it’s implemented within your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ~~~python\n",
    "  # Using quick sort for performance gains\n",
    "  ~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tagging:**\n",
    "  The use of tagging can be used to label specific sections of code where known issues or areas of improvement are located. \n",
    "  Some examples are: `BUG`, `FIXME`, and `TODO`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ~~~python\n",
    "  # TODO: Add condition for when val is None### \n",
    "  ~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules of Commenting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Should be kept brief and focused\n",
    "- Avoid using long comments when possible\n",
    "\n",
    "Essential rules as [suggested by Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/when-good-comments-go-bad/):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep comments as close to the code being described as possible.\n",
    "- Don’t use complex formatting (such as tables or ASCII figures).\n",
    "- Don’t include redundant information. Assume the reader of the code has a basic understanding of programming principles and language syntax.\n",
    "- Design your code to comment itself. 💪\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commenting Code via Type Hinting (Python 3.5+)\n",
    "\n",
    "Type hinting was added to Python 3.5 and is an additional form to help the readers of your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "def hello_name(name: str) -> str:\n",
    "  return (\"Hello {name}\")\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "You can immediately tell that \n",
    "\n",
    "- the function expects the input `name` to be of a type `str`, or string. \n",
    "- the expected output of the function will be of a type `str`, or string, as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documenting Code Base using Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docstings Background\n",
    "\n",
    "**Docstrings are built-in strings that, when configured correctly, can help your users and yourself with your project’s documentation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has the built-in function `help()` that prints out the objects docstring to the console. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "def say_hello(name):\n",
    "  \"\"\"A simple function that says hello\"\"\"\n",
    "  print(f\"Hello {name})\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    ">>> help(say_hello)\n",
    "Help on function say_hello in module __main__:\n",
    "\n",
    "say_hello(name)\n",
    "    A simple function that says hello\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docstring Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Docstring conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are described within [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)\n",
    "- Purpose: provide your users with a brief overview of the object. \n",
    "- Should be kept concise enough to be easy to maintain but still be elaborate enough for new users to understand their purpose and how to use the documented object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In all cases, the docstrings should use the triple-double quote (`\"\"\"`) string format.** This should be done whether the docstring is multi-lined or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "At a bare minimum, a docstring should be a quick summary of whatever is it you’re describing and should be contained within a single line:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "\"\"\"This is a quick summary line used as a description of the object.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-lined docstrings are used to further elaborate on the object beyond the summary. All multi-lined docstrings have the following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A one-line summary line\n",
    "- A blank line proceeding the summary\n",
    "- Any further elaboration for the docstring\n",
    "- Another blank line\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "\"\"\"This is the summary line\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the further elaboration of the docstring. Within this section,\n",
    "you can elaborate further on details as appropriate for the situation.\n",
    "Notice that the summary and the elaboration is separated by a blank new\n",
    "line.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Notice the blank line above. Code should continue on this line.\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "All docstrings should have the same **max character length as comments (72 characters).** \n",
    "\n",
    "Three major categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Docstrings:** Class and class methods\n",
    "- **Package and Module Docstrings:** Package, modules, and functions\n",
    "- **Script Docstrings:** Script and functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "class SimpleClass:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Class docstrings go here.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def say_hello(self, name: str):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Class method docstrings go here.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "        print(f'Hello {name}')\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Class docstrings should contain the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A brief summary of its purpose and behavior\n",
    "- Any public methods, along with a brief description\n",
    "- Any class properties (attributes)\n",
    "- Anything related to the interface for subclassers, if the class is intended to be subclassed\n",
    "\n",
    "The class constructor parameters should be documented within the `__init__` class method docstring. \n",
    "\n",
    "Individual methods should be documented using their individual docstrings. Class method docstrings should contain the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A brief description of what the method is and what it’s used for\n",
    "- Any arguments (both required and optional) that are passed including keyword arguments\n",
    "- Label any arguments that are considered optional or have a default value\n",
    "- Any side effects that occur when executing the method\n",
    "- Any exceptions that are raised\n",
    "- Any restrictions on when the method can be called\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Package Docstrings:\n",
    "\n",

    "  - A list of any classes, exception, functions, and any other objects exported by the module\n",
    "  - Docstring for a module function should include the same items as a class method\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Script Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripts: single file executables run from the console. \n",
    "\n",
    "Docstrings for scripts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Placed at the **top of the file** \n",
    "- should be documented well enough for users to be able to have a sufficient understanding of how to use the script\n",
